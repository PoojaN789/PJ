        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
      <p class="secondHalf">
        ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

      <p class="rest">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated

        ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù

  Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
  <p class="END">
  ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>
